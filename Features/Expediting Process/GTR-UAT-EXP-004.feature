Feature: 0.0.4 - Raising a Purchase Requisition - Non-stocked Item


There is demand in the storeroom that has not been met by the automatic reorder process (either not on reorder or not depleted to reorder point). As such an ad-hoc order is required. The item is under contract price and so no carriage charge is required.
