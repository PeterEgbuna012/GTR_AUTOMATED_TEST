Feature: 0.0.012 - Labor Skill-Level Check - Update skill-levels

The CMS functionality awards qualifications to delegates on completion of a CMS work order. As part of this process, the system checks the labor record's skill-level to verify whether the qualification should or should not be awarded the qualification (if a craft/skill-level requirement is specified on an individual qualification record)

This guide covers the steps to update or add any skill-levels that need to be checked as part of this system check. This is managed via the Business Rules (BRDB) application. 

NOTE: Skill-levels of SKILLED or SEMI-SKILLED do not need to be added to the business rule as this are automatically checked by the system.
